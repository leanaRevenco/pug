		<h1>interior design</h1>
		<h3>description</h3></h3>
		<p>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a 
		building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment
		for the people using the space. An interior designer is someone who plans
		, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior
		design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development,
		space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating 
		with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and
		execution of the design.

		<p>I am interested in this career because it includes a multitude of ways in which you could design certian places,
		therefore you dont have a "formula" in which you decorate each house alike</p>
