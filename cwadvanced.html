      <span>R&B history</span>
      <p>Rhythm and blues, frequently abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated within 
        African-American communities in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings
        marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when "rocking, jazz based music ... [with a] heavy, 
        insistent beat" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through 
        the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and 
        sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience 
        of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism,
        oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations</p>

      <h2>Lord Byron, ‘She Walks in Beauty’.</h2>
                  
        <p>She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
        Of cloudless climes and starry skies<br>
        And all that’s best of dark and bright<br>
        Meet in her aspect and her eyes <br>
        Thus mellowed to that tender light <br>
       Which heaven to gaudy day denies …</p>
